# FCS — 12-Month Development Milestones
## Investor Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key development steps for the first 12 months of the Flexionization Control System (FCS) project.

---

## **Q1 — Core Foundation (Months 1–3)**

**Technical**
- Finalize the full FCS Whitepaper v1.0  
- Stabilize SDK architecture (F / E / F⁻¹ / G operators)  
- Implement 3–4 practical examples:
  - servo control  
  - UAV attitude axis  
  - robotic arm joint  
- Release SDK v1.1 (developer-ready)

**Business**
- Launch minimal landing website  
- Prepare investor Pitch Deck v1.0  
- Define early adopter profile (UAV & robotics integrators)

---

## **Q2 — Integration & Validation (Months 4–6)**

**Technical**
- Integrate FCS with PX4 or ArduPilot simulation  
- Build physical testbench:
  - STM32 controller  
  - servo + IMU  
  - logging & visualization tools  
- Publish benchmarking results vs classical PID  
- Add multi-axis support  
- Release SDK v1.2 (hardware-ready)

**Business**
- Start outreach to robotics labs and drone startups  
- Collect 3–5 letters of interest (LOI)

---

## **Q3 — Scaling & Productization (Months 7–9)**

**Technical**
- Create plug-and-play FCS modules for common MCUs  
- Add ROS2 integration package  
- Add automatic tuning tools  
- Release SDK v1.3 (production-ready)

**Business**
- Partnership with at least 1 hardware platform  
- Beta testing program launch  
- Prepare documentation v2.0 (API reference + tutorials)

---

## **Q4 — Commercial Readiness (Months 10–12)**

**Technical**
- Finalize FCS v1.0 stable release  
- Add safety layer & fallback behaviors  
- Publish open benchmark datasets  
- Initial certification research (UAV/robotics safety)

**Business**
- Secure first commercial pilot integration  
- Prepare licensing model (dual license + enterprise)  
- Investor update package (metrics, demos, results)

---

## **Summary of Key Deliverables**

- **SDK v1.0** — production-ready nonlinear control system  
- **Whitepaper v1.0** — complete technical foundation  
- **PX4/ArduPilot integration** — UAV-ready  
- **ROS2 integration** — robotics-ready  
- **Hardware testbench** — real-world validation  
- **Beta program + first commercial pilot**

---

## **Outcome for Investors**
After 12 months, FCS becomes a validated deep-tech control architecture ready for commercial licensing in:

- UAV systems  
- Robotics hardware  
- Industrial automation  
- Precision motion systems
