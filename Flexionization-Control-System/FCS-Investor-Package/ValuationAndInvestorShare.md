# Valuation & Investor Share

This document outlines the proposed valuation, investment structure, and equity allocation for the FCS project at the pre-seed stage.

---

## 1. Pre-Seed Valuation

We propose the following valuation range based on:

- a functioning deep-tech prototype (FCS-SDK),
- validated mathematical framework (FXI–Δ–E),
- early traction through demos (UAV, servo, nonlinear system),
- clear 12–18 month roadmap,
- strong market demand in robotics & UAV sectors.

### **Proposed pre-money valuation:**  
**$1.5M – $2.5M**

This range aligns with typical pre-seed valuations for deep-tech, robotics, and embedded systems startups with a working prototype.

---

## 2. Investment Amount

We are raising:

### **$300,000 – $500,000 (pre-seed round)**

These funds will support:

- team expansion (embedded, robotics, applied math),
- hardware test bench and UAV/robotics equipment,
- SDK development and integration,
- pilot deployments with industry partners.

---

## 3. Proposed Equity for Investors

Based on valuation and raise size:

| Raise Amount | Pre-Money Valuation | Post-Money Valuation | Investor Equity |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| $300,000     | $1.5M                | $1.8M                 | **~16.7%**       |
| $300,000     | $2.0M                | $2.3M                 | **~13.0%**       |
| $500,000     | $2.0M                | $2.5M                 | **~20.0%**       |
| $500,000     | $2.5M                | $3.0M                 | **~16.7%**       |

### Recommended equity range to offer:
**12% – 20%**, depending on investor type and raise size.

This range is typical for pre-seed rounds and preserves healthy founder ownership.

## 4. Why This Valuation Is Reasonable

### **1. Deep-tech advantage**
- FCS introduces a novel control architecture replacing PID — a rare, valuable innovation.

### **2. High-entry technical barrier**
- Advanced math, control theory, real-time C++ engineering.
- Hard to replicate and requires expert-level knowledge.

### **3. Working prototype (not idea-stage)**
- SDK works in 3 independent domains: UAVs, servos, nonlinear dynamics.

### **4. Massive market**
- UAV + Robotics + Industrial Automation: **$250B+** TAM.

### **5. Strong roadmap and clear milestones**
- Path to FCS v1.0 and commercial pilots is well-defined.

### **6. Competitive advantage**
- FCS sits between PID simplicity and MPC performance — unique positioning.

## 5. Ideal Investor Profile

This round is suitable for:

- deep-tech and robotics investors,
- UAV/robotics manufacturers,
- embedded systems funds,
- early-stage accelerators / incubators,
- strategic partners in industrial automation.

---

## 6. Outcome

This investment will allow FCS to:

- finalize commercial-grade version **FCS v1.0**,  
- complete 3–5 pilot programs,  
- build the core engineering team,  
- establish early partnerships,  
- prepare the technology for large-scale adoption.

---

This valuation structure provides investors with a fair equity position while preserving long-term control and scalability for the project.
